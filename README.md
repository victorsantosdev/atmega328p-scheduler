<b> Real-Time ATmega328p thread-based scheduler for multi-threading with AVR controllers </b> <br />
  <br />
This kernel is cooperative for now, i.e, each thread calls yield() when finished its processing block to <br />
free the cpu to be used in another threads. <br />
Totally compatible and tested in Arduino board with ATmega328p microcontroller. <br />
